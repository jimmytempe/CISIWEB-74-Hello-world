      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is James Burk. I am the current president of the Chaffey College Cybersecurity club
	  and the main student advisor for capture the flag training. Click on the WTF is CTF link to 
	  learn more about it.</p>
      <h2>My Career</h2>
      <p>I graduated Chaffey with my CIS and Cybersecurity degrees from Chaffey last May, along with a history degree and several certificates. I am currently still attending Chaffey in order to finish up some classes I wanted to take, like this one, and also to use up a scholarship. I am also attending Western Governors University full time. I just finished my semester there by receiving my CompTIA Network+ certification. I am also currently trying to get an entry level IT/Help Desk position just to get experience.</p>
      <h2><i>Read This!</i> before moving on:</h2>
	  <p>If you were like me, and thought you didn't know anything and there was no way you	
	  could do this 
	  tech stuff, you and I were both wrong. Alongside my courses at Chaffey, the cybersecurity club has 
	  taught me so much about the IT world and programming, not just hacking. I knew nothing 
	  about Linux going into my first meeting of the club, and now... I still know very little, 
	  but a mountain more than if I had allowed my fear to keep me from participating in the club. 
	  With that said, anyone can email me at <a href = "mailto: jburk4672@panther.chaffey.edu">James Burk</a> 
	  and ask me anything about the club, or even your worries, and I would be happy to address anything for
	  you.</p>
