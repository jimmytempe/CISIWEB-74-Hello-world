		<h3>What does all this mean though?</h3>
		<p>To be blunt, it means a lot. Here is why, most of that information can help a 
		hacker know what tools to use to attack your system. It can also help them
		identify ways to social engineer you so you will download a virus that gives
		them control of your system. There are many exploits out there that don't even 
		require you to have a virus. They are called exploits and they allow a hacker 
		to gain access to your system, and the operators I just listed allow them to 
		figure out which one of those exploits to use. It even tells them what version
		you are using so they can fine-tune the attack.</p>
		<p>Following are some articles about exploits and some of the practices to shore up your defenses against attacks:</p>

		<h3>Here is my two top things I recommend you do NOW.</h3>
		<p>First, change how you use passwords. I know I said two things, but the following three things are part of the first one:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Stop using a password and start using a passphrase replacing letters 
			with characters. Here is an example that you should not use, but it is 
			an example: 
			<br>maryhadalittlelamb. 
			<br>Except you write that like this: 
			<br>M@rrYh@d@1177131@mB. 
			<br>If you look at it, I replaced the letter a with an @ symbol, 
			the letters L and I with the number 1, and the letter T with the number 7.
			I also randomly capitalized letters. Think of your favorite quote or a joke.
			My passphrase is approximately 30 letters long, give or take 4 letters 
			just to keep myself safe. When I first used it, I messed up a lot, but then I 
			got the hang of it and now it's second nature. Even thought the random characters
			and capitalizations can be brute-forced by software, a 20 plus long character password can't,
			at least at the moment. Quantum computing will change all that and passwords will be a thing
			of the past, but that's a whole other story. </li>
			<li>Use two, or even threee, factor authentication. That means you not 
			only use your password, but you also have to get a code off of your phone,
			or you have to click a button in an app, or you have to plug in a USB device.
			 I bought my wife a Yubikey online for Christmas. I'm not endorsing it, but she said 
			 that it was a bit of work setting it up, but once she did, she loves it and feels 
			 much safer. I have a lot of websites that will text me some sort of key on top of using 
			 my password. The nice thing about Yubikey is that a lot of those websites skip that if you 
			 have the key plugged into a USB port on the device you are trying to connect with the site.</li>
			<li>Finally, use a password manager. The only good argument against this is that if
			they get hacked, they have all your passwords. That is true. I use LastPass and 
			they have been hacked and I've had to change all my passwords. It was a pain. But that 
			happens so rarely, the benefit outweighs the detriment. If you use one of these, you randomly 
			generate a long password (see number 1 on this list) that can be as long as you want, 
			and you never have to remember it. And it can't be bruteforced with today's modern
			 computers. You only have to remember one password and you're good to go. This is 
			 valuable because you should never use the same password twice for anything, and this 
			 let's you do that easily. Look into it just by searching 'password managers'.</li>
