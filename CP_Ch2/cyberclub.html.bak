      <h2>The Chaffey College Cybersecurity Club</h2>
		<p>The best way to tell you about the club, is to give you an idea of how the meetings go and what we do in them. Here is a general list of how we structure our formal meetings:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>We open the meeting with announcements from our club advisor, Professor Nimri</l1>
			<li>I go over old business, which there is rarely any, and ask if there is new business, which is not often. Basically, this is housekeeping stuff.</li>
			<li>I try to welocome and introduce new members, as well as some old ones.</li>
			<li>We then discuss cybersecurity news, events, CTF schedules, training schedules, and whatever else comes to mind.</li>
			<li>At this point I try to play a short video, preferrably 5 minutes or less, but never more than 20 minutes. Its usually fairly informative. The topic can be on hacking, getting a job of any sort, and news.</li>
			<li>I then demo some hacking, and I usually ask people to follow along with me on their own computers if they can.</li>
			<li>I end the meeting by asking for feedback as well as answering any questions, then a little bit of housekeeping to close the meeting out.</li>
			<p>Keep in mind, that we can joke around and do stuff as all of this goes on. This format I'm giving is for the Zoom meetings, because that is all the school allows right now.</P>
			<h4>Discord</h4>
			<p>We also have a Discord channel. That is very informal, has a fair amount of people who don't go to the official meetings, as well as some alumni. We talk about everything in there. It can be a little colorful in language, so not for the faint of heart. It can be a lot of fun though, especially when we do voice. We also help each other out a lot with our homework in there. It seems like any time of day or night, someone is in there willing to talk or help.</p>
			<h4>Training</h4>
			<p>I try to train people when we can all agree on a time. That time changes constantly depending on different folks' interests and schedules. When we do train, it can be a lot of fun.</p>
			<p>In all, we try to not be too serious and just have fun. The people who are really good at tech truly enjoy helping those who are new and just starting out. You never need to be embarrassed if you don't understand something in our club. We welcome everyone from everywhere.</p>
			<h3>You can't enjoy life if you don't show up.</h3>
			<p>- Yet another of James Burk's great quotes.</p>
