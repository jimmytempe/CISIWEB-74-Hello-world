<h1>Hello World, My Name is James Burk</h1>

<img src="me.jpg" alt="James Burk" style="width:300px;height:400px;" align="center">

<h3>Here are some things about me:</h3>
 
<ol>
	<li>I have already graduated from Chaffey with four degrees and seven certificates. Here are the degrees:
		<ul>
			<li>Cybersecurity</li>
			<li>Computer Information Systems</li>
			<li>University Studies</li>
			<li>History</li>
		</ul>
	<li>I love the technology field and everything about it, which is why I want to be in cybersecurity for a living. </li>
	<li>I also love history as another passion, hence the history degree.</li>
	<li>I love to hike and camp. I do it as often as my body and budget will allow.</li>
	<li>I am happily married for almost 7 years and I have a wonderful 28 year old son who is a compsci major here at Chaffey. He is taking CompSci 4 with our professor this semester and will graduate in May.</li>
	<li>I am currently attending Western Governors University working on my bachelors degree in cybersecurity. My current class is for getting the CompTIA Network+ certificate.
	<li>I am the current president of the Chaffey College Cybersecurity Club.
		<ul>
			<li>With that said, if you have any interest in joining, and all majors are welcome, feel free to shoot me an email to <a href="mailto:jburk4672@panther.chaffey.edu">jburk4672@panther.chaffey.edu</a> and I would be happy to answer any question you may have. Again, everyone is welcome!</li> 
			<li>Some things we do are learning how to hack (ethically), technology news, job hunting information, speakers (on Tuesday Jan. 25th at 3:30PM we will have a speaker from Microsoft discussing things like internships, mentorships, job skills they look for, etc.), and we also watch some informative videos.</li>
			<li>One last thing we do, which is a lot of fun and all skill levels are welcome, is we do hacking competitions both as a school team and individually. It is a lot of fun and you really learn a lot about networks, Linux, vulnerabilities, etc.</li>
		</ul>
</ol>
